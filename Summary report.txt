->Steps Followed for Credit Risk Prediction:
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. Performed feature engineering to derive behavior-based indicators:
   - Total_Delays, Avg_Payment_Ratio, Payment_Consistency, Credit_Utilization.
3. Handled missing values and encoded categorical data.
4. Scaled numeric features and split the data (stratified).
5. Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
6. Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC.
7. Visualized performance using confusion matrices.

->Challenges faced and contributions:
1.Imbalanced dataset → Solved with stratified sampling.
2.Zero division errors → Solved using .replace(0, 1) in ratios.
3.Categorical encoding → Solved using OneHotEncoder.
